Box 2 contains a simulation model that compares dispersal-diversity relationships with and without dormancy, under different types of dispersal-dormancy covariation.

Box 3 contains an analysis of dispersal-dormancy covariation for aquatic invertebrate species that commonly inhabit tank bromeliads. The data for this analysis is from the following source:
