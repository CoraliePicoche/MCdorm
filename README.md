# MCdorm

This repository contains the code to make the figures and perform analyses associated with the manuscript:

Nathan I. Wisnoski, Mathew A. Leibold, and Jay T. Lennon. 2019. "Dormancy in metacommunities". The American Naturalist: 194 (2), 135-151.	

*Box 2* contains an analysis of dispersal-dormancy covariation for aquatic invertebrate species that commonly inhabit tank bromeliads. The data for this analysis is from the following source: 

Régis Céréghino. 2018. Constraints on the functional trait space of aquatic invertebrates in bromeliads. Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity. [doi:10.5063/F1VD6WMF](https://doi.org/10.5063/F1VD6WMF).

*Box 3* contains a simulation model that compares dispersal-diversity relationships with and without dormancy, under different types of dispersal-dormancy covariation.
